Let's take a look at how a journal can enhance you and your career.
</p><p></p><p>
First, it gives you the opportunity to see all that you have accomplished, as well as, your five- and 10-year goals.</p><p> Second, logging achievements, ideas, and employer/peer reviews and advice will help you prepare a short presentation when it comes time to ask for a raise or apply for a position with greater responsibility.</p><p> If you approached your supervisor with an idea that created an efficient work space or improved upon a process, jot it down. And, the fact that you approached your supervisor shows you are not intimated, you are confident; and proposing an idea shows initiative and creativity – two factors that make a great employee. Suppose a customer commented on how well you helped them (maybe they won't say anything to your supervisor or write the company about you), but YOU can. Jot it down.</p><p> Third, it will provide important information that can be added to your résumé. You'll save a lot of time for yourself and the writer by keeping these notes. Even if you've already been working for years, it's never too late to start one, adding the previous 10 years' worth of information.
</p><p></p><p>
Start by creating a manila folder or a one-inch, three-ring binder with sections and tabs. That way, each category is separate; you can access each one in a couple of seconds. Keep a regular notebook at your work desk to jot down notes quickly then take it home, when you have a few to list, and transfer your notes to the original journal.</p><p></p><p>
Keep the original updated frequently. If you are laid off, or the company closes, you won't be scrambling to gather all that information; your time will be better spent writing your résumé or giving the information to a professional to write, while you search for another job.
</p><p></p><p>
So many times, clients have come to me with sloppy notes, and 99% of the time, not enough information. After they complete the questionnaire, the telephone interview reveals even more experience or accomplishments that they neglected to list on the questionnaire – information that had just slipped their mind. If they had kept a journal, all their information would have been available.
</p><p></p><p>
Another reason to keep notes, is to review your accomplishments and ideas at a time when you're feeling a bit low or unappreciated; doing so will provide you with the confidence you need to keep going. Sometimes a job can be overwhelming and you feel as though you are sucked into it's vortex. You lose sight of the fact that you are a valuable employee and you simply need to be reminded.
</p><p></p><p>
Remember, too, with technological advances for hiring managers, you may literally compete with thousands of applicants. It's imperative to have the best information about your knowledge and skills available at a moment's notice, whether you hire a professional, are networking, or have your eye on a promotion.
</p><p></p><p>
It's your life, your career, your money, and your happiness...so don't delay! Get started on being even better at what you do and let your work journal help to direct your success. Your documented experience can propel you to an even better future in your career.
</p><p></p><p>
Best wishes in your endeavors!</p><p>
